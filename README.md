# CipherByte Technologies - Internship Projects
This repository contains solutions to two machine learning problems tackled during my internship at CipherByte Technologies. These projects showcase practical implementations of Python and machine learning techniques.

## 1. Email Spam Detector
Problem Statement:
Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email sent to a massive number of users, often containing cryptic messages, scams, or phishing content. The goal of this project is to develop an email spam detector using Python and machine learning. The model is trained to classify emails as either "spam" or "non-spam" based on their content

## 2. Iris Flower Classification
Problem Statement:
Iris flower classification is a classic dataset in machine learning. The task is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
